# Decentralized Government Procurement System

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based solution for government procurement processes. By utilizing smart contracts and decentralized technology, the system enhances transparency, reduces corruption, streamlines bidding procedures, and improves accountability in public procurement while ensuring fair competition among vendors.

## Key Components

### Vendor Verification Contract
- Validates qualified government suppliers through a decentralized registry
- Maintains immutable records of vendor credentials, certifications, and performance history
- Implements tiered verification levels based on vendor qualifications and past performance
- Facilitates periodic re-verification to ensure continued compliance
- Prevents disqualified vendors from participating in procurement opportunities
- Stores dispute history and resolution outcomes

### Tender Publication Contract
- Manages public procurement opportunities with transparent distribution
- Maintains immutable tender specifications and requirements
- Implements programmable procurement rules and eligibility criteria
- Records and timestamps all tender modifications and clarifications
- Provides equal and simultaneous access to procurement information
- Supports various tender types (open, restricted, negotiated procedures)

### Bid Submission Contract
- Securely records and seals proposal details until bid opening
- Ensures tamper-proof storage of bid documents and pricing
- Implements time-locked bid encryption until submission deadline
- Maintains cryptographic proof of bid submission timing
- Prevents unauthorized access to competitor bids
- Supports various bid types including technical and financial proposals

### Contract Fulfillment Contract
- Tracks delivery against agreed terms and milestones
- Manages payment disbursement based on verified completion
- Implements multi-stakeholder verification of deliverables
- Records contract amendments and change orders
- Maintains delivery documentation and quality assurance records
- Supports transparent dispute resolution processes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Truffle or Hardhat development framework
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- IPFS node (for decentralized document storage)
- Access to an Ethereum network (testnet or mainnet)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentralized-procurement.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd decentralized-procurement

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx truffle compile

# Run tests
npx truffle test

# Deploy to test network
npx truffle migrate --network sepolia
```

## Usage

The platform serves multiple stakeholders in the procurement ecosystem:

### For Government Agencies
- Publish procurement opportunities with transparent specifications
- Evaluate vendor qualifications through verified credentials
- Manage sealed bid processes with cryptographic integrity
- Track contract fulfillment and vendor performance
- Generate audit-ready procurement records

### For Vendors
- Complete verification process and maintain credentials
- Access procurement opportunities through transparent channels
- Submit secure and timestamped bid proposals
- Track contract fulfillment and payment status
- Build verifiable performance history

### For Oversight Bodies
- Monitor procurement processes for compliance
- Access immutable records of tender, bid, and award decisions
- Verify proper execution of procurement regulations
- Review vendor verification and qualification processes

### For Public
- Access non-sensitive procurement data for transparency
- Verify fair competition and selection processes
- Track government spending and contract outcomes
- Monitor vendor performance on public contracts

## Security Considerations

- Zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive bid information
- Multi-signature requirements for critical procurement actions
- Role-based access controls for different procurement functions
- Regular security audits of smart contracts
- Compliance with relevant procurement regulations
